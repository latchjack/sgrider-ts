When we make use of generics, we're essentially working with something very similar to function arguments.
When we work with functions we pass in arguments to customise how the function body behaves.

With generics we're going to define classes and functions and we're going to customise the different types inside of those class/function definitions by passing in a type, as though it were a like an argument.

Generics will allow us to define the type of a property inside of a class, the arg to a function and the return type of a function.
